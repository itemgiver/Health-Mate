# Health Mate

A lot of people who exercise want to work out with other people. Therefore, we created the "Health Mate" application to help users to find their health mate. They can easily see other people's profiles and approach them by sending messages. There are four main functionalities in this app. Search Page, Home Page, Chat Page, and Setting Page. People can use these functions by pressing the buttons at the bottom. We put a demo link and videos below, so take a look if you want.
